Core Components 1. CssFramework The main entry point that orchestrates the entire processing pipeline. It handles parsing, compilation, post-processing, and CSS generation. Location: src/MonorailCss/CssFramework.cs 2. Utilities System Self-contained components that compile CSS class candidates into AST nodes. Each utility handles specific CSS properties: Static utilities extend BaseStaticUtility for fixed property/value mappings Functional utilities extend BaseFunctionalUtility for theme-aware dynamic values Specialized base classes exist for common patterns (colors, spacing, filters) Location: src/MonorailCss/Utilities/ 3. Candidate System Represents parsed utility classes with variants and modifiers. The CandidateParser tokenizes and structures raw class names. Location: src/MonorailCss/Candidates/ 4. AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Intermediate representation of CSS rules before final generation. Includes Declaration , Rule , ComponentRule nodes. Location: src/MonorailCss/Ast/ 5. Processing Pipeline Multi-stage transformation pipeline that processes AST nodes through: Theme variable tracking Arbitrary value validation Negative value normalization Color modifier processing Important flag handling Variable fallback resolution Declaration merging Media query consolidation Layer assignment Location: src/MonorailCss/Pipeline/ 6. Theme System Manages design tokens and CSS custom properties. Supports theme customization and usage tracking for optimization. Location: src/MonorailCss/Theme/ 7. Variant System Handles pseudo-classes, media queries, and other CSS modifiers. Built-in variants are automatically registered. Location: src/MonorailCss/Variants/ Key Design Patterns Auto-Discovery : Utilities are automatically discovered via reflection at startup Priority System : Utilities have priorities (0-1000) determining evaluation order Immutable Data : Extensive use of immutable collections Pipeline Architecture : Modular stages for processing transformations Theme Resolution : Values resolved through namespace chains with fallback support Arbitrary Values : Support for user-defined values in square brackets [value] Testing Strategy The project uses integration testing rather than unit testing individual utilities. The main test file tests/MonorailCss.Tests/Interactive/AllUtilitiesIntegrationTest.cs verifies that utilities generate expected CSS properties. When adding new utilities: Create the utility class in appropriate category folder Add test cases to AllUtilitiesIntegrationTest.cs Verify all tests pass before committing On this page Core Components 1.
